4. Configuration				*lsp-configuration*

To register a LSP server, add the following lines to your .vimrc file:
>
   let lspServers = [
		\     {
		\       'filetype': ['c', 'cpp'],
		\       'path': '/usr/local/bin/clangd',
		\       'args': ['--background-index']
		\     },
		\     {
		\	'filetype': ['javascript', 'typescript'],
		\	'path': '/usr/local/bin/typescript-language-server',
		\	'args': ['--stdio']
		\     }
		\     {
		\	'filetype': 'sh',
		\	'path': '/usr/local/bin/bash-language-server',
		\	'args': ['start']
		\     },
		\   ]
   call lsp#addServer(lspServers)
<
The above lines add the LSP servers for C, C++, Javascript, Typescript and
Shell script file types.

To add a LSP server, the following information is needed:

	filetype	One or more file types supported by the LSP server.
			This can be a |String| or a |List|. To specify
			multiple multiple file types, use a List.
	path		complete path to the LSP server executable (without
			any arguments).
	args		a list of command-line arguments passed to the LSP
			server. Each argument is a separate List item.

The LSP servers are added using the lsp#addServer() function. This function
accepts a list of LSP servers with the above information.
